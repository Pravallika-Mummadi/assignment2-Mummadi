###### Carroms (India)

I love to play **Carroms** .It was during lockdown days when my family and I used to play daily. It proved to be a great interest and addiction for me. This game helped in **reducing our stress** and gave us **great joy**. **Dedication, self-confidence and patience will instill in us by playing games**.
